# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description 
For this project i have created a daily planner for an average work day. This application features the moments.js API to capture real time so that the planner can be used on a daily basis. As real time passes, it will set the background color of each timeslot to indicate whether the time has past, or if it is the current hour, or whether the timeslot has not passed yet. You are also able to save your notes within each timeslot and come back to it later to review your agenda for the day.
